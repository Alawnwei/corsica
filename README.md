# Corsica

Corsica is a plug and a DSL for handling [CORS][cors-wiki] requests.
[Documentation can be found online][docs].

![Nice Corsica pic][image]
*(I had to include a nice pic because, let's be honest, CORS requests aren't the
most fun thing in the world, are they?)*

## Features

* Ignores requests without an `Origin` header (yay, performance!)
* Handles preflight requests, including invalid requests where the request
    method or the request headers are not allowed
* Compiles CORS-enabled resources into functions based on pattern-matching in
    order to take advantage of the optimizations made by the VM (yay, double
    performance!)
* Is compliant with the CORS spec description from [MDN][cors-mdn] and from
    [html5rocks.com][cors-html5rocks].

## Usage

The `Corsica` module can be used both as a stand-alone plug:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Endpoint do
  plug Corsica,
    origins: ["http://foo.com"],
    max_age: 600,
    allow_headers: ~w(X-Header),
    allow_methods: ~w(GET POST),
    expose_headers: ~w(Content-Type)

  plug Plug.Session
  plug :router
end
```

as well as a *plug generator*. Using it as a plug generator allows for finer
control over the options and the headers of CORS responses; using the `Corsica`
module in an arbitrary module automatically makes that module a plug that can be
used in your application.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.CORS do
  use Corsica,
    origins: "*",
    max_age: 600,
    allow_headers: ~w(X-My-Header)

  resources ["/foo", "/bar"], allow_methods: ~w(PUT PATCH)

  resources ["/users"],
    allow_credentials: true,
    allow_methods: ~w(HEAD GET POST PUT PATCH DELETE)
end

# MyApp.CORS can now be used as a regular plug.
defmodule MyApp.Endpoint do
  plug MyApp.CORS
  plug :router
end
```

This is only a short overview of what Corsica can do; for more detailed
information and for a reference on the methods and options that can be used with
Corsica, refer to the [online documentation][docs].
